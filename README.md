# Running a discord bot on commodity hardware and Balena

This project provides a small proof of concept showcasing the ability to run a discord bot 
on a cluster of devices managed through Balena. The underlying libraries used are all 
commonly available (`serenity` for the discord API, and `midir` to interface with `ALSA`).
